Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
  The driverPass project was a project about a company(DriverPass) that wanted to help the student take classes in person and online.
  They wanted to have a dashboard for them to be able to schedule classes, cancel classes, etc.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I think I did ok with everything but I would definetly revise the diagrams as I am not great at making them.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  I made sure to make the needs a priority, It is important because they are the client and we need to make sure their needs are met when designing.
